## Methodology: 
+ Demographic data for 234 countries worldwide was scraped from "https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/" for analysis.
+ GDP per country data for 189 countries was fetched from "www.imf.org/external/datamapper/api/v1/NGDP_RPCH?periods=2024" API adress.
+ Two datasets were combined based on the common countries in both data frames.
+ The Python script named Project_Script_final19.py has been created and utilized for data sourcing.
+ Each group of countries was mapped and integrated into the interactive dashboard.
+ All the functions in both script and main files were tested by unit and performance tests in "Testing script file"

## Conclusion
+ By exploring these different categories, users can gain a better understanding of the demographic distribution across different countries worldwide. 
+ This dashboard aims to provide valuable insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making for a wide range of users interested in demographics and global trends.
